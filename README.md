# Reproduction study: Argument Similarity with AMR

This project reproduces the paper "Explainable Unsupervised Argument Similarity Rating with Abstract Meaning Representation and Conclusion Generation"(Opitz et al., ArgMining 2021) [(link)](project_docs/OpitzEtAl21.pdf). 

It will also include an extension. Currently a work in progress.

This project is a so called "Project Module", part of the [Cogniive Systems](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/studium/what-to-study/master/masters-courses-from-a-to-z/cognitive-systems) Master program at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam).

## Setup and usage

### Environment recreation 

In the folder ```setup/``` you can find the respective environment replication and package requirements files. There are two options:

1. You can run ```pip install -r setup/requirements.txt``` to install the necessary packages in your existing environment.

2. If you are using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to manage your virtual environments, you can replicate and activate the full exact environment with the following commands:

   ```
   conda env create --name <name> --file setup/conda.yml
   conda activate <name>
   ```
